It was structured specifically for Feldenkrais Method&reg; training and has high-quality audio and video systems. At the institute, students can enjoy many of the comforts of home, such as kitchenettes with fridges, teapots, and microwaves.

Though it has a population of 120,000 people, Ann Arbor has the performing arts activities and dining options of a much larger city. In Ann Arbor and the surrounding area, FIAA students can explore the university’s free museums, enjoy farmer’s markets, attend art classes, take kayak trips, or go shopping downtown.</p>
