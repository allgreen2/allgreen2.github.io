                        <p>There is a growing need for Feldenkrais&reg; practitioners in diverse fields such as health care, performing arts, graceful aging and wellness programs, sports training, behavior modification, and psychology. The Feldenkrais Institute of Ann Arbor seeks to fill this need by training the next generation of practitioners.</p><p>We offer a hybrid program that blends flexible online courses with in-person training retreats in beautiful Ann Arbor, Michigan. During training retreats, students receive hands-on instruction from our dedicated staff.</p><p>After 2 years, students may apply to the Feldenkrais Guild&reg; of North America (FGNA) for temporary authorization to teach Awareness Through Movement&reg; (ATM) classes while enrolled in the training program. They can also join FGNA and be listed in a directory where clients can easily find them. The full program takes about 3 and a half years to complete.</p><p>The FGNA certification guidelines state that training must be completed within 7 years. Graduates must apply to the FGNA for certification, and renew certification annually, in order to practice. Professional practice may be subject to additional federal, state or local government requirements. Neither Awareness Through Movement&reg; lessons nor Functional Integration&reg; sessions may be offered professionally before graduation from an accredited training program. Interim authorization as a Trainee Awareness Through Movement teacher is a student teaching position. <br><a class="btn" href="#admissions">Apply Now</a></p>

                    <p><br>The institute is in a brand new building located in downtown Dexter, a beautiful suburb of Ann Arbor. <br>The building was designed to foster a community environment that allows for individualized learning. It was structured specifically for Feldenkrais Method&reg; training and has high-quality audio and video systems. At the institute, students can enjoy many of the comforts of home, such as kitchenettes with fridges, teapots, dishes, dishwashers, and microwaves.</p>

FIAA is also one block from the scenic Border to Border trail that connects Dexter to Ann Arbor and other cities. This nonmotorized 35-mile trail has peaceful views of trees and the Huron River.<br><br>Neighboring Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan and offers a vibrant student community. Though it has a population of 120,000 people, Ann Arbor has the performing arts activities and dining options of a much larger city. In Ann Arbor and the surrounding area, FIAA students can explore the university’s free museums, enjoy farmer’s markets, attend art classes, take kayak trips, or go shopping downtown.</p>
